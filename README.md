# structure_identification_of_nds

Clean code of the product from my Master Thesis: <br> 
**"STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION OF
NETWORKED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
UNDER PARTIAL OBSERVABILITY AND COLORED
NOISE VIA MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS"**

where the topology of the network of networked dynamical systems is inferred from the activity of the nodes (time series)

## Content
- **training.ipynb** - explains the training process for the model and the architecture
- **tutorial.ipynb** - explains the process of generating the graphs, the time series and the colored noise
